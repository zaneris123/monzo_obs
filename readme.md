## Monzo_obs

I decided to create an overlay for my streams to display my monzo bank balance in real time.
This includes the ability to show transactions as notifications in real time.

### Tech-stack
- Firebase cloud function
- Realtime databasing
- NodeJS

### considerations and implementation

Monzo provides developers the ability to develop applications that allow users to manage or integrate with their banks, In the case of my implemnations I decided to not use the api as using Auth2 within a hosted overlay would be too convuluted to do. So instead I decided that an effective solution was to use the available webhook available on the monzo developer portal to send transations to a created endpoint.

These webhook entries include information such as the data type and incase of transaction, the amount deposited/withdrawn from the account, aswell as description and time.
Example of transaction json:
```
{
	"type": "transaction.created",
	"data": {
		"account_id": "acc_00008gju41AHyfLUzBUk8A",
		"amount": -350,
		"created": "2015-09-04T14:28:40Z",
		"currency": "GBP",
		"description": "Ozone Coffee Roasters",
		"id": "tx_00008zjky19HyFLAzlUk7t",
		"category": "eating_out",
		"is_load": false,
		"settled": "2015-09-05T14:28:40Z",
		"merchant": {

			},

		}
	}
}
```


For the endpoint firebase realtime databasing allows me to directly make data creation requests directly to the database using a restful endpoint without having to setup a backend saving development time.
So using firebase functions I would be able to create a trigger when a data entry is created, to update a number which would be used to keep track of the account balance, This balance will have to be intially inputted manually into the database.
One issue I had to take into consideration is when a transaction is made, 4 entries ar added to the database instead of just 1, So using the uniquie ID tied to each transaction I can prevent the same transaction being processed multiple times.

### The overlay

Once the cloud function was implemented and I was able to track my balance in real-time within the realtime database. Next I just had to setup a pure html and js page that I would be able to use directly within my OBS as an overlay locally.

For my implementation I used the script import module of firebase and firebase database,

```<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.0.0/firebase-app.js"></script>```
```<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/8.0.0/firebase-database.js"></script>```

Using this module I was able to use the ```.on()``` function which allows me to implement event base functionality for when a select value changes within the database, So that when the balance updates within the database it also updates in on my overlay in realtime.
